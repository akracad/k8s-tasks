## âœ… **Kubernetes Task: Explore DaemonSet, CronJob, and Job**

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:

Understand and implement **DaemonSet**, **CronJob**, and **Job** in Kubernetes to manage node-level workloads and scheduled tasks.

---

### ðŸ“˜ **Task List**

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Create a DaemonSet

* [ ] Create a DaemonSet using the `busybox` image.
* [ ] The container should run the following command in a loop:
  `while true; do echo Daemon running on $(hostname); sleep 30; done`
* [ ] Confirm that the DaemonSet creates **one Pod per node** in the cluster.
* [ ] Use `kubectl get pods -o wide` to verify that Pods are spread across all nodes.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Understand and Apply Cron Syntax

* [ ] Research and understand basic cron expression format.
* [ ] Identify the correct cron expression for scheduling every 5 minutes:
  `*/5 * * * *`

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Create a CronJob

* [ ] Create a CronJob in Kubernetes using the `busybox` image.
* [ ] The job should run every 5 minutes and print:
  `"40daysofkubernetes"`
* [ ] Set `restartPolicy: OnFailure`
* [ ] Apply the CronJob and confirm it's scheduled correctly:

  * Use `kubectl get cronjobs`
  * Use `kubectl get jobs --watch` to observe job execution

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Verify Output

* [ ] Check logs of the executed job Pods to confirm the message was printed:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <job-pod-name>
  ```

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Clean Up Resources

* [ ] Delete the DaemonSet
* [ ] Delete the CronJob

  ```bash
  kubectl delete daemonset <name>
  kubectl delete cronjob <name>
  ```

---

#### ðŸ““ Task 6: Document Learnings

* [ ] Write a short summary explaining:

  * What is a DaemonSet and when to use it
  * What is a CronJob and its real-world use cases
  * What is the difference between a CronJob and a one-time Job
  * How cron expressions work
* [ ] Include code snippets, YAMLs, and command outputs in your notes or blog

---

#### ðŸ“¢ Task 7: Share Publicly

* [ ] Share your experience on LinkedIn or Twitter.
* [ ] Mention what you implemented and learned.
* [ ] Tag the project or mentors if applicable.
* [ ] Use the hashtag:
  `#Kubernetes #DevOps #LearningInPublic #40DaysOfKubernetes`
