## ✅ **Kubernetes Task: Node Selectors, Labels, Selectors & Static Pods**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Explore how to:

* Schedule Pods manually (Static Pods)
* Label and filter resources using `kubectl`
* Restart control plane components
* Understand node-specific pod placement via labels/selectors

---

### 📘 **Task List**

---

#### 🧱 **Task 1: Manually Schedule a Pod Without the Default Scheduler**

* [ ] Create a pod manifest (e.g., `manual-pod.yaml`) and **omit** the `nodeName` field.
* [ ] Disable the scheduler temporarily (optional) to prevent automatic placement.
* [ ] Manually assign the pod to a node using `nodeName` in the YAML.
* [ ] Apply the pod and confirm it schedules correctly:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```

---

#### ⚙️ **Task 2: Explore Static Pods**

* [ ] SSH into the **control plane node**.
* [ ] Navigate to the static pod manifest directory (usually `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`).
* [ ] Identify files like:

  * `kube-apiserver.yaml`
  * `kube-controller-manager.yaml`
  * `kube-scheduler.yaml`
* [ ] Restart a control plane component by touching/saving its file (this will auto-restart it via Kubelet):

  ```bash
  sudo touch /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
  ```

---

#### 🔖 **Task 3: Create Pods with Labels**

* [ ] Create 3 pods using the `nginx` image:

  * `pod1`: label `env=test`
  * `pod2`: label `env=dev`
  * `pod3`: label `env=prod`

Example (pod2):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2
  labels:
    env: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

* [ ] Apply all 3 pod manifests.

---

#### 🔍 **Task 4: Filter Pods by Labels**

* [ ] Use the following `kubectl` commands to filter pods:

  * Show only `dev` and `prod`:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l 'env in (dev,prod)'
    ```

---

### 📓 **Task 5: Document Learnings**

* [ ] Write a short summary explaining:

  * What are static pods and when to use them
  * Difference between static pods and scheduled pods
  * How Kubernetes uses labels and selectors
  * How to restart control plane components using manifests
  * How to filter Kubernetes objects using label selectors

---

### 📢 **Task 6: Share Your Learnings**

* [ ] Create a blog post or LinkedIn/Twitter post
* [ ] Include:

  * YAML snippets
  * Label filtering commands
  * Observations on static pods and manual scheduling
* [ ] Tag relevant communities or mentors
* [ ] Use hashtags:
  `#Kubernetes #DevOps #LearningInPublic #40DaysOfKubernetes`
