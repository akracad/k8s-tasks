## 📘 **Task: Deep Dive into Kubernetes vs Standalone Containers**

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Understand the limitations of using standalone containers and how Kubernetes addresses those limitations. Reflect on your learning and share it with the community.

---

### ✅ **Instructions:**

### 1. 🚀 **Explore & Document**

* Write a short explanation of how standalone containers (e.g., using Docker alone) work.
* List the **challenges** you faced or foresee when running containers without orchestration.

  * E.g., scaling, self-healing, networking, monitoring, configuration.

### 2. 🤖 **Understand Kubernetes**

* Document **how Kubernetes solves each of the challenges** listed above.

  * Use diagrams, comparisons, or real examples.

---

### 3. 🔍 **Evaluate Use Cases**

#### ✅ When to Use Kubernetes (List 5):

Examples:

* Large-scale microservices
* CI/CD workflows
* Auto-scaling applications
* Multi-cloud deployments
* Canary/blue-green deployments

#### ❌ When **Not** to Use Kubernetes (List 5):

Examples:

* Simple single-container apps
* Serverless-first workloads
* Very small teams with no DevOps
* Apps without scaling needs
* Quick prototypes or MVPs

---

### 4. 🧠 **Reflect & Share**

* 📓 **Document your learnings** in a concise write-up (blog, Notion, markdown, etc.)

  * Include: what you learned, biggest surprise, key takeaways.
  * Format: bullets, visual notes, or short-form blog post.

* 📢 **Share publicly**:

  * Post a summary on **LinkedIn or Twitter** with:

    * Hashtags like `#Kubernetes #DevOps #CloudNative`
    * Tag mentors or peers if applicable
    * Link to your full blog or repo if available

---

### 🏁 **Deliverables**

* ✅ A write-up or blog with comparisons and use cases
* ✅ A LinkedIn/Twitter post sharing your learning publicly
* ✅ Optional: Create a visual (diagram or mindmap) summarizing your takeaways
